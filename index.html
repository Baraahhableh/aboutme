    <main>
 <p> This is Bara'ah and I'm 29 years old. I'm a French lecturer at the university of Jordan and I really like teaching.
     This year, I became interested in progamming languages since it became the language of this era, so in order to be part of this numeric 
    world, I decied that I should be involved in this field. </p>
    <p> As a matter of  fact, there's one thing made me more interested about programming is that there is something in common between learning other languages and programming:
        they're both languages so they both demand time, patience and dedication. They both remind us,  as well, taht hard work will eventuallly pay off.
