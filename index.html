    <main>
 <p> 
     This is Bara'ah and I'm 29 years old. I'm a French lecturer at the university of Jordan and I really like teaching.
     This year, I became interested in progamming languages since it became the language of this era, so in order to be part of this numeric 
    world, I decied that I should be involved in this field. </p>
    <h2> education and experience</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li> I have a BA in French language and litterature and a master's degree in translation </li>
        <li> I have a modest expreince t=in teaching Arabic to non native speakers from the university of Jordan</li>
        <li> I teach French at the university of Jordan</li>
    </ul>

    <p> As a matter of  fact, there's one thing made me more interested about programming is that there is something in common between learning other languages and programming:
        they're both languages so they both demand time, patience and dedication. They both remind us,  as well, taht hard work will eventuallly pay off. 
    </p>
